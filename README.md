# Griddyverse

Griddyverse is an unofficial game artwork database designed for platforms like Steam. This project aims to provide a repository for game artwork, including backdrops, clearart, logos, and icons, for games that are not available on Steam or for artwork that has been removed from Steam.

## Overview

In the gaming community, artwork such as game covers, backdrops, and logos play a significant role in showcasing the visual appeal of games. However, some games may not be available on popular platforms like Steam, or their associated artwork might be removed over time.
